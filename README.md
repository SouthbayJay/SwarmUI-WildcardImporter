     chara_jobs:
       scifi_jobs:
         mobile_trooper:
           - scifi, mecha musume, helmet, huge gauntlets, gray mobile suit, exoskeleton, heads-up display, visor,

   ```

2. **Import via UI**

   - Navigate to the **Wildcard Importer** tab within SwarmUI.
   - Drag and drop your `ponyxl-jobs.yaml` file into the designated dropzone or click to select the file manually.
   - Click on the **Process Wildcards** button to initiate the import.
   - Monitor the **Processing Status** panel for real-time updates.

3. **Resulting Folder Structure**

   After successful processing, the following structure will be created in the `ponyxl-jobs` folder:

   ```
   ponyxl-jobs/
   â”œâ”€â”€ scifi_jobs.txt
   â”œâ”€â”€ scifi_jobs/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mobile_trooper.txt
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ netrunner.txt

   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... other modern job categories
   â””â”€â”€ ... other primary categories
   ```

   Each `.txt` file contains the respective job entries, formatted as comma-separated values.

### Processing `halloween.yaml`

   - Click on the **Process Wildcards** button to initiate the import.
   - Monitor the **Processing Status** panel for real-time updates.

3. **Resulting Folder Structure**

   After successful processing, the following structure will be created in the `BoHalloween`  and `halloween` folders:

   ```
   BoHalloween/
   â”œâ”€â”€ random-location.txt
   â”œâ”€â”€ random-ppl.txt
   â””â”€â”€ ... other random categories
   halloween/
   â”œâ”€â”€ Atmosphere.txt
   â”œâ”€â”€ Atmosphere.txt
   â”œâ”€â”€ Decorations.txt
   â””â”€â”€ ... other categories
