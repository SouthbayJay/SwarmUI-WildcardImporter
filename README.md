**Resulting Folder Structure**

After successful processing, the following structure will be created in the `ponyxl-jobs` folder:

```
ponyxl-jobs/
â”‚   (top level wildcard containing all scifi jobs as <wildcard:mobile_trooper>, <wildcard:netrunner>, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ scifi_jobs.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ scifi_jobs/
â”‚   â”‚  (contains all the lines for the mobile_trooper wildcard)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mobile_trooper.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ netrunner.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... other scifi job categories
â”œâ”€â”€ modern_jobs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part-timer.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ racer.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... other modern job categories
â””â”€â”€ ... other primary categories
```

Each `.txt` file contains the respective job entries, formatted as comma-separated values.

Consider the following example:

```yaml
BoHalloween:
  random-location:
    - __halloween/Places-Sceneries__, __halloween/Atmosphere__, __halloween/Decorations__, __halloween/Symbols-Icons__,
      __halloween/Lighting__, __halloween/ArtStyles__
  random-ppl:
    - "__halloween/Costumes__, __halloween/Atmosphere__, __halloween/Food-Treats__, __halloween/Lighting__,
      {__halloween/Symbols-Icons__,|__halloween/Grimaces__,|__halloween/Symbols-Icons__,|__halloween/Traditions__,|}"
  # ... other random categories
halloween:
  Atmosphere:
    - Bewildering
    - Bewitched
    - Bloodcurdling
    - Bone-chilling
    - Chilling
    - Creepy

    - Black Cats
    - Candelabras
    - Cauldrons
    - Cobwebs
    - Coffin Props
    - Crystal Balls
  # ... other categories
```
After successful processing, the following structure will be created in the `BoHalloween`  and `halloween` folders:

```
BoHalloween/
â”œâ”€â”€ random-location.txt
(contains all the lines for the random-location wildcard, in the example above it would be <wildcard:halloween/Places-Sceneries>, <wildcard:halloween/Atmosphere>, <wildcard:halloween/Decorations>, <wildcard:halloween/Symbols-Icons>, <wildcard:halloween/Lighting>, <wildcard:halloween/ArtStyles>)
â”œâ”€â”€ random-ppl.txt
(contains all the lines for the random-ppl wildcard, in the example above it would be <wildcard:halloween/Costumes>, <wildcard:halloween/Atmosphere>, <wildcard:halloween/Food-Treats>, <wildcard:halloween/Lighting>, <wildcard:halloween/Symbols-Icons>, <wildcard:halloween/Grimaces>, <random:<wildcard:halloween/Symbols-Icons>,|<wildcard:halloween/Traditions>,|<wildcard:halloween/Symbols-Icons>,|<wildcard:halloween/Traditions>,|)
â””â”€â”€ ... other random categories
